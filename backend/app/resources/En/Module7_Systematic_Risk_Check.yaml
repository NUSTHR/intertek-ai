title: "GPAI Systemic Risk Check"
description: "Determines if a GPAI model has systemic risk based on the quantitative threshold in Article 51(2) or a designation decision under Article 51(1)(b)."

questions:
  - id: "q7.1"
    text: "Does the general-purpose AI model meet either of the following criteria for classification as a model with systemic risk?"
    ref: "Art 51, Annex XIII"
    description: "A model is classified as having systemic risk if it meets the training compute threshold or if the Commission has explicitly designated it as such."
    type: "single_choice"
    options:
      - label: "The cumulative amount of computation used for its training is greater than 10^25 floating point operations (FLOPs) (Art 51(2))"
        value: 1
      - label: "The Commission has adopted a decision designating the model as having systemic risk based on capabilities or market impact (e.g., >10,000 business users) (Art 51(1)(b))"
